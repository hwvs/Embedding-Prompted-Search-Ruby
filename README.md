# Embedding-Prompted-Search-Ruby
Ruby library for searching documents/books using OpenAI API (GPT) to find related embeddings, enabling LLM-based tasks such as answering questions about authors or their books with context provided by the related embeddings.

# Todo
- Create a "factory" or "builder" class to do all of the heavy-lifting
- Auto-detect which provider to use for a document based off of MIME/extension? Not sure how this could work.
- Clean up the class names which might not meet Ruby standards
- **Create more Tests!**

# Usage
